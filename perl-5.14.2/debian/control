Description: Perl 5.14.2 without thread support

 This is an additional package of Perl for Debian based systems. It offers a
 modern version of Perl (5.14.2). Unlike the system Perl, it consists of a
 single package that installs the perl binary, perldoc, all core modules, and
 a libperl.so.
 .
 All of this is installed under /opt/perl5.14.2 to avoid conflicts with the
 system Perl.
 .
 This package has been compiled without thread support.
